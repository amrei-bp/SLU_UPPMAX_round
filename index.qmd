# Access to Compute and Storage Resources

This page provides an overview of how to apply for pay-as-you-use compute and storage resources at UPPMAX, what systems are available, how to manage your allocation, and where to get support.

## How to Apply

## Available Systems

Through the SLU round, the following resources can be applied for at UPPMAX:

- **Pelle**: compute resources. Can be applied for individually, or with additional storage on Gorilla. 
- **Gorilla**: active project storage. Can be applied for individually, or in an application together with a compute project on Pelle. 
- **Lutra**: long term storage. Needs to be applied for in a separate application from Pelle and/or Gorilla.

## Duration of Allocations

Allocations on Pelle and Gorilla can be requested for up to a year at a time. If needed, they can be renewed for up to another year at a time, for as long as you need the resources. You will receive an email reminder before your current allocation expires. 

Once no longer needed, you can simply remove your data and not request a prolongation of your project when it is running out. 

Storage allocations on Lutra will be granted for four years at a time. 

Questions pending confirmation:
- Is termination handled through SUPR?  Yes, should be automatic. **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**
- Is a one‑month notice period required? Again, that should be automatic - if no resources are used none are billed. **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**
- Should users notify NAISS, SLU IT, or both? Sounded like they don't have to notify anyone, just not use the allocations anymore.  **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**

## Billing

Billing follows the Uppmax pricing model, but will be send out, and paid to SLU-IT. 

You will be invoiced for the resources your are using, not for the ones you have allocated to your project.

Points to clarify:

- Who issues the invoice? NAISS/Uppmax or internal SLU? Invoice comes from SLU - what's the procedure? **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**

- Where does the researcher enter a project number or cost center? NOT CLEAR YET. **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**

- Is internal SLU invoicing used? Yes, see above. **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**
