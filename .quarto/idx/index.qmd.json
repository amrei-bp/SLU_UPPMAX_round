Can be applied for individually, or with additional storage on Gorilla. \n- **Gorilla**: active project storage. Can be applied for individually, or in an application together with a compute project on Pelle. \n- **Lutra**: long term storage. Needs to be applied for in a separate application from Pelle and/or Gorilla.\n\n## Duration of Allocations\n\nAllocations on Pelle and Gorilla can be requested for up to a year at a time. If needed, they can be renewed for up to another year at a time, for as long as you need the resources. You will receive an email reminder before your current allocation expires. \n\nOnce no longer needed, you can simply remove your data and not request a prolongation of your project when it is running out. \n\nStorage allocations on Lutra will be granted for four years at a time. \n\nQuestions pending confirmation:\n- Is termination handled through SUPR?  Yes, should be automatic. **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**\n- Is a one‑month notice period required? Again, that should be automatic - if no resources are used none are billed. **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**\n- Should users notify NAISS, SLU IT, or both? Sounded like they don't have to notify anyone, just not use the allocations anymore.  **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**\n\n## Pricing\n\nThe table below is fetched from the [UPPMAX Terms and fees](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/terms-and-fees) page:.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# Load table\nurl <- \"https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/terms-and-fees\"\npage <- read_html(url)\ntables <- html_table(page, fill = TRUE)\nprice_table <- tables[[3]]\n\n# Filter to selected rows and Pelle column\nfiltered <- price_table %>%\n  select(Service, Pelle, \"Pelle Cloud\")\n\nfiltered %>%\n  kable(format = \"html\", table.attr = \"class='table table-striped'\", escape = FALSE) %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n```\nPrices can change with no warning.\n\\* Small GPUs are Nvidia T4 and Nvidia A2\n** Medium GPU are Nvidia A100 and Nvidia L40S\n*** Lutra is sold in increments of 50 TB, 4 year minimum\n\n\n### Example: Annual cost for a small project\n\nBased on the [UPPMAX price list](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/terms-and-fees).\n\n#### Storage on Gorilla\n- Data volume: **2 TB**  \n- Price: **0.1 SEK per TB-hour**  \n- Calculation:  \n  *2 TB × 365 days × 24 hours/day × 0.1 SEK/TB-hour*  \n- **Annual storage cost: 1,752 SEK**\n\n#### Compute on Pelle\n- Compute use: **24,000 core-hours**  \n- Price: **0.1 SEK per core-hour**  \n- Calculation:  \n  *24,000 × 0.1 SEK*  \n- **Annual compute cost: 2,400 SEK**\n\n#### **Total annual cost**\n**4,152 SEK**\n\n---\n\n### Example: Annual cost for long term data storage\n\nBased on the [UPPMAX price list](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/terms-and-fees).
