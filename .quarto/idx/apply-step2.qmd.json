Log in to SUPR: <https://supr.naiss.se>  \n2. Go to the section for **Rounds** on the menu on the left side.  \n3. Below the panels for the different default rounds, click: **\"You can also view all rounds (including closed and decided).\"\" **\n4. Under **\"Local Rounds\"** select **\"SLU Local 2026\"**\n5. Click **\"Create New Proposal for SLU Local 2026\"** to start a new application.\n\n## Fill in the Application\n\nWhen you apply for resources in the SLU Local 2026 round, you can create your proposal in two different ways.\n\n**Option 1: Create a new proposal**\n\nIf you have not applied for a project before, or want to start a new one you need to start a completely new proposal and enter everything from scratch.\n\nFill in the title of your project and click `Create New Proposal`for this option. \n\n**Option 2: Copy an earlier proposal**\n\nIf you have applied before, you can save time by copying (cloning) one of your previous proposals.\nTo do this, choose an earlier proposal from the list. SUPR will use it as a template, and you can update or change any details as needed.\n\nChoose which proposal to clone from the drop-down menu and click `Clone Proposal` for this option. \n\n## Application sections\n\nThe application comes in several different sections. Each section starts with a title, the information that is already listed, or needed, and a grey button that lets you add to or change information. Fields marked with a red asteriks are mandatory. Once you have edited the information in a section, click `Save Changes` to commit them to the proposal.\n\n### Proposal\n\nGeneral information of the proposal. These fields help identify your proposal and show where it is in the application process. You will not have to change anything here. \n\n### Basic Information\n\nThis is the first section you need to edit. \n\n#### Project Title\n\nChoose a short and clear title that describes your project.  \nExample: *Genome assembly of forest insect pests*.\n\n#### Affiliation \n\nMake sure you select **Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet** for the affiliation. \n\n#### Abstract\n\n**[MORE INFO NEEDED - payment information]**\n\nWrite a short summary of your project in plain language.  \nInclude:\n\n- what you will study  \n- what methods you will use  \n- what you need the compute and storage resources for  \n\nBudget and Billing Information\n\nProvide:\n\n- SLU project number and/or cost centre  \n- responsible person for the budget  \n**Without that your project will not be approved. **\n\n**[MORE INFO NEEDED: exact format of project numbers and any required reference text for invoices]**\n\nThis text helps reviewers understand the purpose of your project.\n\n#### Resource Usage\n\n**[MORE INFO NEEDED - how much do we need here?]**\n\nDescribe how you plan to use the compute and storage resources. For example:\n\n- type of analyses (RNA-seq, WGS, metagenomics, modelling, etc.)  \n- expected number of samples or runs  \n- how often you will run jobs (e.g. daily, weekly, only in certain periods)  \n\nThis helps show that the requested resources match your planned work.\n\n#### Requested Duration and Start Date\n\nSet how long you want the allocation to last. With the drop-down menu, you can choose any duration between 1 month and 1 year, in one month increments. \n\nSet a desired start day. If you do not choose anything, the date will be as soon as possible. \n\n### Classification\n\nHere you give the **scientific area** of your project. \n\nStart typing and choose from the selection, or select from the provided homepage. \n\n### Continuation\n\nThis section shows whether your proposal is linked to an earlier project.\n\nIf it is a new project you do not have to do anything. If this project is meant to be a continuation from an earlier project, click `Change`and select from the list that will be presented to you. \n\n### Co-Investigators\n\nYou can add co-investigators to the application if other people should:\n\n- help manage the project  \n- have access to the compute and storage resources\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf you want to designate a **proxy** (someone else who can manage the proposal or project on your behalf), you must first add this person as a **co-investigator**.\n:::\n\n### Resources\n\nFrom the drop-down menu, you can add resources to the proposal. Select the resource that you want to add, and click `Add Resource to Proposal`. \n\nYou have three options: \n\n1. Choose `Lutra` if you want to apply for **long term storage**. Then you cannot apply for any of the other resources. If you want to apply for other resources, you need to fill in a separate application. \n\nLutra is allocated for four years at a time, in increments of 50 TB. Choose at minimum 50 000 GiB. \n\nYou can choose a custom directory name for your project, or accept the automatic default. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe number of files depends on the type of data you want to store. As a rule of thumb, you can calculate around 1 million files per TB of data. \n:::\n\n2. Choose `Pelle` if you want to have a project with **both compute and storage capacity**. You can either choose computation with the default storage capacity of **500 GiB** and **1 000 000 files**, or add more storage on `Gorilla` to the same proposal. You can choose a custom directory name for your project, or accept the automatic default. \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe number of core hours you should request depends on the type of project you will work on. As a rule of thumb you can calculate with 1 000 h/ month for every 1TB of data you expect to have. \n\nFor a small project, applying for 2 - 3 thousand hours is usually sufficient. \n:::\n\n3. Choose `Gorilla` if you only want active storage capacity. You can choose a custom directory name for your project, or accept the automatic default.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf you want to analyse the data, multiply the amount of raw data by 5 to 7. Then calculate the number of files with 1 mio per 1TB of data. \n:::\n\n### Cancellation\n\nIf you decide that you **do not** want to submit the proposal:\n\n- You can **cancel** it using the cancellation button in this section.\n\nUse this if the proposal was created by mistake or if the project will not go ahead.\n\n\n### Submission\n\nYour proposal will only be considered for allocation if you **submit** it.\n\n1. Check that all mandatory fields are completed.  \n2. Submit the application in SUPR.  \n3. You will receive a confirmation email from SUPR.  \n4. The application is reviewed according to SLU and NAISS procedures.  \n5. You are notified by email when the allocation has been approved.\n\n**[MORE INFO NEEDED: expected review time and decision schedule]**\n\n## After Approval\n\nWhen your application is approved:\n\n- The project and allocation are created in SUPR, and activated from the requested starting date.  \n- Users added to the project are granted access to the selected systems.  \n\n**If you do not have an account at UPPMAX**, you need to apply for one before you can access the servers: \n\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary w-100\" role=\"button\" style=\"padding: 1rem; font-size: 1.1rem;\" href=\"apply-step3.qmd\">Step 3: Apply for an UPPMAX account</a>\n\n\nIf you **already have an account at UPPMAX**, you can immediately proceed to connect and start using the resources:\n\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary w-100\" role=\"button\" style=\"padding: 1rem; font-size: 1.1rem;\" href=\"apply-step4.qmd\">Step 4: Access after Approval</a>\n---\n\nFor questions about how to fill in the application, contact:  \n**support@slu.se**\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nOnce you have a SUPR account, you can apply for compute and storage resources through the **SLU Local 2026** round.\n\n## Before You Apply\n\nPrepare the following information:\n\n- Project title and short description  \n- Estimated compute needs (cores, memory, runtime)  \n- Estimated storage needs (GB or TB, and expected duration)  \n- Internal project number or cost centre for billing (**[MORE INFO NEEDED: required SLU financial details]**)\n\n## Find the “SLU Local 2026” Call in SUPR\n\n **[MORE INFO NEEDED]**\n\n1.
