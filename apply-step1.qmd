To request compute and storage resources, you must first have an active user account in the NAISS/SUPR system.

## What is NAISS/SUPR?

NAISS (National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden) provides national high-performance computing and storage resources.  
SUPR is the web portal used to manage:

- user accounts  
- project applications  
- resource allocations  

You access SUPR here: <https://supr.naiss.se>

## Who Can Apply?

- Employees and researchers at SLU can apply to get resources via the SLU round. 

## Create a SUPR Account

1. Fill out & submit [account request form](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/).

::: {.callout-tip}
- Use Register with Federated Identity if you are enrolled in a Swedish university.
- If you are not enrolled in a Swedish university or if the previous option doesn't work for you, use instead Register without Federated Identity.
:::

2. Fill in your contact details and affiliation with **SLU**.  
3. Confirm your email address if requested.

::: {.callout-tip}

When registering or updating your profile:

- Select **Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet** as your organisation.  
- Add your research group, department or unit in the profile description if relevant.  

This makes it easier to link you to the correct projects and allocations.
:::

## After Your Account Is Created

Once your SUPR account is active, you can:

- be added as a member to existing projects, and  
- submit new applications in calls such as **“SLU Local 2026”**.
