When your project has been approved in SUPR, your allocation on **Gorilla**, **Pelle** and/or **Lutra** becomes active.

## When Is Access Activated?

- Access is granted as soon as the allocation is approved and registered in SUPR.  
- You do not need to submit any additional forms.  
- You and your project members can log in using your existing credentials.

**[MORE INFO NEEDED: typical delay between decision and technical activation, if any]**

## Login and Connection

You normally access the systems via SSH from a terminal.

Example (replace user and host with the correct ones):

```.bash
ssh your-username@gorilla.XXX
ssh your-username@pelle.uppmax.uu.se
ssh your-username@lutra.XXX
```

**[MORE INFO NEEDED: Exact directory paths and structure on Gorilla, Pelle, and Lutra], VPN?**

If a VPN or SLU-specific network access is required, add:

## Project and Storage Locations

After logging in, users usually have access to:

- a personal home directory  
- a project directory linked to the SUPR project  
- a scratch or temporary directory for short-term work  

**[MORE INFO NEEDED: Exact directory paths and structure on Gorilla, Pelle, and Lutra]**

Please also clarify:

- recommended locations for active project data  
- scratch data retention rules  
- procedures for long-term storage  

## Software and Modules

The systems typically use a module-based environment for software management. Users can list, load, and switch between available tools.

**[MORE INFO NEEDED: Confirm the module system in use and list recommended default modules or environments]**

If container solutions such as Conda, Apptainer, or Singularity are recommended, link or describe them here.

## Running Jobs

Compute jobs are generally submitted through a batch scheduling system such as SLURM.

**[MORE INFO NEEDED: Confirm scheduler type and provide guidance on job submission, job limits, and example workflows]**

Clarify:

- queue names (if any)  
- limits on job size or runtime  
- recommended job submission practices for bioinformatics workloads  

## Monitoring Usage and Quotas

Users should monitor:

- storage consumption  
- used and remaining CPU/GPU hours  
- allocation status  

Monitoring may be available via the SUPR web portal or local system tools.

**[MORE INFO NEEDED: Describe where users can check quotas and usage metrics]**

## End of Allocation and Data Management

Before the allocation ends, users should:

- remove unnecessary intermediate files  
- transfer long-term data to approved archival storage  
- ensure compliance with SLU data management and security guidelines  

The termination and renewal procedures (notice period, where to request changes, etc.) remain **[MORE INFO NEEDED]** and will be updated when confirmed.
